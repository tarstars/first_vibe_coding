Create an app where I can manage a simple todo list. This is a learning project; I mainly want to understand how to write programs in Python, CSS, and HTML.
Use Python for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend. The app must let me enter a new task for the list, mark tasks as completed, and delete a task from the list.
The user interface should include an input field, an add button, and a delete button. Each task in the list should be markable as done.
